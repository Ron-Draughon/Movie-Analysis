## Version 1 – Individual Film ROI Analysis

This folder contains the original version of the Movie ROI analysis.

This version calculated ROI by averaging individual film ROI percentages, which was useful for exploratory analysis but did not accurately reflect how studios invest across a slate of films.

The project was later updated to use a portfolio-level ROI approach, aggregating total budgets and total gross revenue before calculating ROI.

This archived version is retained for historical reference.
